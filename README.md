# ELEC2645 Unit 2 Project Template

** PLEASE DELETE THIS README AND REPLACE IT WITH YOUR OWN README.md FILE DESCRIBING YOUR PROJECT **


This is the basic code for a command line application which you should use for your Unit 2 project.

The code has separated the menu handling code in `main.c` and the function implementations in `funcs.c`. You should add your code to `funcs.c` (or you can create new files if you wish), and update `main.c` to call your functions from the menu.


### 1 Run code

You can build the code as we have been using in the labs with 
`gcc main.c funcs.c -o main.out -lm` (the `-lm` is required to link the math library). You can also use `make -B` to force a rebuild using the provided `Makefile`.

Then run the code with `./main.out`


### 2 The assignment

Please read the assignment brief on the Minerva page for details of what you need to implement. 



### 3 Test command

The `test.sh` script is provided to check that your code compiles correctly. This is what the autograder will use to check your submission. You can run it with `bash test.sh` or `./test.sh` or just `make test`. 

You do not need to modify this script, but you can look at it to see what it does.


### 4 Submit Solution

Use the same method as previous labs to commit and push your code to your GitHub repository for the autograder to check. 

In your final journal post, please include a link to your GitHub repository containing your code  *and* a zip file of your code as an attachment.
