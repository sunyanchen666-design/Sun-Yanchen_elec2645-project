### 1 Run code

You can build the code as we have been using in the labs with 
`gcc main.c funcs.c -o main.out -lm` (the `-lm` is required to link the math library). 

Then run the code with `./main.out`

My menu1 is a Trigonometric Function Calculator which can calculate sine,cosine, and tangent for any angle or radians. My menu 2 is a Statistical Analyzer that can calculate mean, median, variance, and standard deviation.My menu3 is the RC Circuit Simulator models capacitor charging and discharging over time, displaying voltage and current at each step. My menu4 is a Circuit Analyzer computes total resistance, current, and voltage drops for both series and parallel configurations.
